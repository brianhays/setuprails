# Setup Rails
The automated Rails installer.

The installer currently supports OS X 10.9 and above. Instructions and a summary of installed packages are [available on the homepage.](http://setuprails.com)

## Why this installer?
Setting up Ruby on Rails for the first time can be tedious. This script provides you with the latest stable versions of Ruby and Rails along with ‘smart defaults’ that allow you to start developing immediately (or expand on as you see fit).

## Development
Please feel free to submit pull requests and/or file bugs on the [issue tracker.](https://github.com/brianhays/setuprails/issues)
